* Internal Error - The internal system is misconfigured or the judge does not work. Only administrator can solve this problem. No grade.
* Memory-Limit Exceed - Your program has used up the maximum memory alloed. Grade is 0.
* Multi-Status - There are more than one test case and the judge results of each test case are not unique. Check <em>information</em> for details. Grade is sum of all grades got from each passed test case.
* Output-Limit Exceed - Your program has outputted too much. Check whether there is any infinite loop which keep outputting. Grade is 0.
* Pending - Your program is waiting in the judge queue. Be patient please. However, if you have been waiting for a long time, perhaps there is something wrong with the online judge. No grade.
* Presentation Error - All the tokens in your output are correct. But the separators (e.g. White spaces, carriage returns, tabs) are different with the standard answer.  Grade is from 0 to maximum. Depends on assignment setting.
* Restricted Functions - Your program has called some dangerous system functions. Grade is 0.
* Runtime Error - Your program performed an illegal operation. Perhaps it was an attempt to access unaccessible memory or call illegal instructions. Grade is 0.
