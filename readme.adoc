= Introduction

The Online Judge plugin for {moodle_url}[Moodle] is designed for courses involving programming. It can automatically grade submitted source code by testing them against customizable test cases https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest[(ACM-ICPC/Online Judge style)].

== Plugin Client

Online Judge Assignment Feedback Plugin: online judge version of the https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Assign_feedback_plugins[official feedback plugin] assignment activity.

The workflow is:

1. Administrators install and config it.
2. Teachers create *Assignment*, choose *Online Judge* as a feedback type, and setup *testcases*, etc.
3. Students submit code in Online Judge Assignment Activities.
4. The <<judge-daemon>> judges the submissions in background.
5. Teachers and students get judge results in Online Judge Assignment Activities.


= Prerequisites

== Linux

* https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/[Moodle] `2.0`-`2.7`, `3.4+`
* `php-cli`
* `make`, `gcc`, `gcc-multilib`, and `g++`.
* `pcntl` and `posix` extension for `php-cli`

=== SELinux 

Ensure that SELinux allows apache to execute outgoing HTTP requests through the following command:

```bash
getsebool httpd_can_network_connect
```
if it is not set true, run:
```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
```

== Windows

* `php-cli`


= Installation / Upgrading

== Cloning

```
git clone -b OJ_VERSION git://github.com/hit-moodle/moodle-local_onlinejudge.git onlinejudge
```

[TIP]
OJ_VERSION is obtained from the available branches.




[TIP]
`MOODLE_PATH` means the root path of your moodle installation.

== Judge Engines

=== Sandbox

If you would like to use sandbox judge engine, then run:
```
cd MOODLE_PATH/local/onlinejudge/judge/sandbox/sand/libsandbox && ./configure
cd ..
make
```

[TIP]
Make sure the file named `sand` is _executable_, and has the following context: `system_u:object_r:bin_t:s0`.



=== Sphere Engine

In order to start using sphere engine, navigate to the following path:

> MOODLE_PATH/local/onlinejudge/judge/sphere_engine/api/

and run:

```bash
composer install
```

[TIP]
Sphere Engine accepts only one file. So, ensure that the "Maximum number of
uploaded files" under "Submission types" is set to `1` when you create an
assignment.

= Usage

== Online Judge Assignment Feedback Type

After installation, there will be a new assignment feedback type called *Online
Judge* appears in the *"Feedback types"* while creating the assignment. Simply
check that box and follow the inline help.

==== Creating an Assignment Activity

After checking the `Online Judge` checkbox, several options will appear:

1. Programming Language (please note that if you installed `libsandbox`, there
will be two instance of the `C` and `C++` programming languages which could be
judged either using `libsandbox` or <<sphere-engine>>, however, the ones
executed by the sandbox engine will have "(run locally)" next to them).
2. "Ratio for presentation error" (please click the question mark symbol next to
that field).
3. "Compile only" (please click the question mark symbol next to
that field).
4. "Link Math Library" (please click the question mark symbol next to
that field).
5. "Allow Warnings" (please click the question mark symbol next to
that field).
6. "Link Static Libraries" (please click the question mark symbol next to that
field). It is recommended to enable that option if you are using `libsandbox`.
7. "Maximum CPU time" (please click the question mark symbol next to that
field).
8. "Maximum memory usage" (please click the question mark symbol next to that
field).
9. "Sphere-Engine Client ID" (If you are using sphere engine, you can find your
client id in the "API Tokens" tab)
10. "Sphere-Engine Access Token" (If you are using sphere engine, you can find your
access token in the "API Tokens" tab)

After creating the assignment, two buttons will appear in the assignment page
context, `Test Case Management` and `Rejudge All` buttons.

==== Test Case Management

If you click the `Test Case Management` button, you will be redirected to a web
form which allows you to specify several test cases which will be tested against
the submitted code. You can specify these test cases either in the textarea
fields or by uploading testcase files and from which the expected input or
output will be read.

You may also choose to specify a grade per testcase (e.g., based on their
difficulty).

=== Rejudge All

This option might come in handy if you have edited the assignment or the judging
options and would like the have the edits reflected in the previously judged
submissions.

If you expand the "Online Judge" tab of a submission, there will be a `Force
Judge` button which allows you to only rejudge that submission.

== Judge Daemon

The judge daemon, which exists in https://github.com/hit-moodle/moodle-local_onlinejudge/blob/master/cli/judged.php[`cli/judged.php`], has several helpful options for debugging purposes. Use `--help` argument for more information.

```
Judge all unjudged tasks.

Options:
-h, --help            Print out this help
-n, --nodaemon        Do not run as daemon (Linux only)
-o, --once            Exit while no more to judge
-v, --verbose         Verbose output

Example:
$sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/php local/onlinejudge/cli/judged.php
```
